        <em><h1>Just a Small Town Girl...</h1></em>
        <p>Born and raised in good ol Texas! I lived just Southeast of Dallas,in a small town called Combine for about 13 years. Then I moved to Lewisville!</p>
        <p> If you would have asked me 10 years ago where I would be doing with my life, I would have told you Married, in the military with no kids, and laying on a beach somewhere enjoying a margirita!</p>
        <p>I never would have thought I'd be a single mother who is going back to school, but I couldn't be more happy about it!</p>
        <b><h2>Starting Over</h2></b>
        <p>I just got off maternity leave and I get "the" phone call from my boss! When I say "the" phone call, I mean the heart cringing "I'm letting you go" phone call. She stated that the company decided to sale the shop and all the employees on that
            side had to be let go.</p>
        <p>To a single mom, this was terrible and I didn't see this coming. I really didn't know how I was going to take care of a new born, or my bills without a job.</p>
        <p>I started applying for any kind of help I could get, but to my dismay I was unable to get the help I needed. I felt very alone and defeated. I wanted to give up! </p>
        <p>A few months later, I was sitting in the living room feeding my son. A commercial came on about getting an education. I ignored it because "30 is too old to go back to school". </p>
        <p>Then it hit me like a brick wall! I said "Jaxton, momma is going back to school" and I know excatly what I want to do! That's when I decided to start school again after 10 long years!</p>
        <h3>Greatful</h3>
        <p> In the end I thank God that I got the oppertunity do what I love. Not only for myself, but for the people I love as well.</p>
        <p>I can't wait to see what the future has in store!</p>
