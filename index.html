        <h4>Pizza in th USA!</h4>
        <p> In the late 19th century, pizza first made it's appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants. It was very popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Trenton and Saint Louis.</p>
        <p> Pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. </p>
        <p>It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their Italian American communities.</p>
